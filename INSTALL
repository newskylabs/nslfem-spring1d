* Installation

1. Preconditions

In order to use the unit tests, the environment variable BOOST_ROOT
has to be defined.

On my system boost is installed in /usr/local (the header fiels are in
/usr/local/include/boost; the libs are in /usr/local/lib) and
BOOST_ROOT is defined (in my bash profile) by

  export BOOST_ROOT=/usr/local


2. Building

Change into the base dir of the directory tree and type `make' to
build the executable.

  cd <some-path>/fgfem
  make


3. Examples

Run the examples with:

  make examples

They can be run one by one with:

  make example-2-1
  make example-2-2
  make example-2-3 
  make example-2-4


4. Unit tests

The unit tests can be run with:

  make test


5. Clean up

You can remove the program binaries and object files by typing:

  make clean

To also remove the binaries type:

  make cleanall


fin.
